## P4Simulator : A P4-driven Network Simulator

P4Simulator is a P4-driven network simulator and the first research effort on applying P4 to network simulation. For key features, follow [our paper poster](https://github.com/ns-4/NS4/blob/master/p4-simulator-poster.pdf) and [our paper](https://github.com/ns-4/P4Simulator-DEV/blob/master/p4-simulator-sosr.pdf).

We also provided beginners' guide to help you get started.

1. [P4Simulator Overview](https://github.com/ns-4/NS4/wiki/P4Simulator-Overview)
2. [Build and Install P4Simulator](https://github.com/ns-4/NS4/wiki/Build-and-Install-P4Simulator)
3. [A Hands-on Example](https://github.com/ns-4/P4Simulator/wiki/A-Hands-on-Example)

P4Simulator is now being developed by NetArch Lab at Tsinghua University. P4Simulator is an open-source project under [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/ns-4/NS4/blob/master/License.md). We are longing for contributions. See [How to Contribute](https://github.com/ns-4/NS4/wiki/How-to-contribute) for details.

*This project is still under development at this time and may not support all P4 programs.*
